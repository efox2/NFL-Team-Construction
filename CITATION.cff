abstract: >-
  Roster construction is critical in any sport for
  the team's subsequent performance. The significance
  of this project is to create better team
  construction strategies for American Football teams
  in the NFL, and the solution can be extrapolated to
  other sports. Multiple factors influence the
  selection process, such as current team
  construction, player skill, financial constraints,
  which may complicate the process of selecting
  53-man rosters since there are several permutations
  for a greedy-search heuristic. The goal of this
  project is to use a Genetic Algorithm to
  objectively select players by integrating an
  ML-based fitness function used to evaluate a teamâ€™s
  quality.
